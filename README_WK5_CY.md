## Week 5 Christopher Yeh Discussion Questions.

1. Describe the Biology of your project? (one paragraph max).  
The biology/science of my project is about physics specifically kinematics. It would be a model that reflects different values of velocity, time and acceleration using kinematic equations. <br>
2. Describe the kind of data that you think you will be handling (one paragraph max).  
This model will not be using pre-existing data but rather different input values for the kinematics equations. Each variable such as velocity or time would have different values chosen by the user that the model could computate. <br>
3. What would you like to do with that data? (one paragraph max).  
The data would be computated through the set kinematics equation and outputted in the desired form depending on what variable is desired. The input would be adjusted through sliders accesible by the user and it would relect on a model in relatively real time. <br> 
4. What will be the output? (one paragraph max).  
The output will be different graphs showing the results of plugging certain values into the kinematics model and can adjust based on the sliders used by the user. The goal is to have the models provide the user with a visual representation of the kinematic equations and how they are used. <br>
5. Is there any computational tool, package, etc. you would like to use? What would you do with that? For instance, you could mention shell scripts with `sed` or `awk` and will change the format of a table by replacing `,` with tabs. 
Also, you could mention tools that we haven’t seen in class yet but you herd that may be useful for your project. 
For instance, you could say 
***I will use the package “GenomeGraphs” implement in the R software to visualize genome data***. (a few sentences max).  
At the moment, the only tools I believe we will need is R studio that has the shinyApps package installed. We can then code directly in Rstudio console to make our shinyApp. <br>
6. What is your biggest concern regarding your project? (a few sentences max). <br> 
The biggest concern is learning how to code shinyApps specifically in R as we have not learned how to do it and what language is required. The next biggest concern would be learning exactly how to display our shinyApp output onto a website that is accessible to all and fits our goals. <br>
